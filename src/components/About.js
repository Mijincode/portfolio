            Hi, I'm Mijin Lee. My educational background is in Teaching, having
            pursued my studies at Queensland University of Technology. The
            allure of the creative possibilities and the inherent
            problem-solving nature of the web development domain has led me to
            take a significant step forward â€“ transitioning into a career as a
            web developer. This decision to shift from teaching to web
            development is deeply rooted in my passion for technology and the
            captivating prospects it offers. While I genuinely enjoyed my time
            in education and cherished the experiences it provided, I find
            myself irresistibly drawn to the dynamic and constantly evolving
            world of web development. There's always been a strong affinity
            within me for technology, which has driven me to proactively engage
            in self-study. Currently, I'm currently pursuing a Graduate
            Certificate program in Information Technology (Web Development) at
            QUT. This journey has been an avenue for continuously expanding my
            knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, and various
            other programming languages. What truly ignites my enthusiasm is the
            process of crafting functional and visually captivating websites and
            applications. This, coupled with the perpetual learning and the joy
            of problem-solving that web development brings, fills me with a
            sense of accomplishment. The possibilities are boundless, and I'm
            eager to contribute my skills to this exciting and dynamic field.
